This repo houses and hosts the stencil and the canonical rules for the No, Mr. Berg! disc dyeing contest.  To enter, interact with the participants, or just check out what the disc dyeing community can do, go to https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMrBerg

# Rules

No, Mr. Berg! is a charity disc dyeing contest. The idea is simple, you dye a specific image onto a Kastaplast Berg, and then "sell it" for as much as you can, where "sell it" means, convince someone you don't know to donate to a well respected charity, and in exchange, you mail them the Berg you dyed.

Note: Although I am thinking of No, Mr. Berg! as a contest, there aren't currently any prizes (working on it though), except for:

* Knowing that you've helped people by moving money to charity.
* Getting better at disc dyeing by swapping tips with your fellow competitors. Speaking from experience, this is not an easy dye job to do well.
* Showing off the prowess you do have via a quantitative measure, namely, the amount you got donated. Perhaps you managed it by making the Mona Lisa of James Bond themed Bergs, or perhaps you did it by being okay at dyeing but great at fundraising, both are fine, either way everyone wins!

Disc dyeing is an art, and to put it mildly art doesn't always play by the rules... so to allow for that creativity there are multiple categories you can enter: Orthodox (you must use the same stencil as everyone else), Freestyle (no hard rules, but stay in the same spirit as the NMB stencil), and Effective Altruist (the only thing that matters is how much you can get given to charity).

## Orthodox Rules:

0) Be excellent to each other.

1) You must dye a Kastaplast Berg.

2) You must use a version of the stencil at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dunmatt/no-mr-berg/main/noMrBerg.svg .

3) You cannot "sell" the disc to yourself.

4) In addition to donating, the "buyer" has to send you a picture of the finished disc, and the receipt from the charity with their username written on it (optionally with the other PII redacted). And you then post that picture here.

5) Not all charities are created equal. Do your research and make sure the money goes to a reputable charity. There are good websites dedicated to helping you figure out which those are.  I would recommend doing your research on either https://www.charitywatch.org/ or https://www.charitynavigator.org/ .

6) You are welcome to make minor adjustments to the stencil to better fit your workflow, as long as you are still attempting to achieve the same look.  If you find some modification invaluable, consider submitting it to the contest so that others can benefit!

## Freestyle "Rules":

Same as Orthodox, except #1 is more of a very good suggestion and #2 doesn't apply at all. Just try to stick with the spirit of the contest.

## Effective Altruist Rules:

0) Be excellent to each other.

1) All entries to each of the above categories are also entered into EA, but they will be judged by how much money they raise rather than how sweet the dye job is.
FAQ:

**Q)** Why Bergs?

**A)** I chose this disc not because it is easy to dye well, but because it is hard!  And let's be real here, also for the Bond pun, but primarily because easy jobs don't make for good portfolio pieces/contest-entries.

**Q)** I finished my disk and it kicks too much ass, I can't bring myself to "sell" it, even for charity, I must bag it! What do?

**A)** Make a second one, and then pick which one to "sell"/enter and which to bag! It's the Solomon strategy applied to a starfish.

**Q)** The stencil sucks! It looks like it was designed by a middle schooler that had never seen Inkscape before! Do I really have to use it??

**A)** Well you're close, I'm not a middle schooler, more of a software engineer. But yes, I agree, that tree leaves a lot to be desired and I didn't know about Inkscape's spiral tool at the time. Feel free to come up with a better version and post it here. If I like yours better I'll push it to Github and it'll become the new Orthodox stencil.

**Q)** Aren't you worried about Trademark/Copyright stuff?

**A)** If the Bond folks want to harass a charity contest they should take a good hard look at themselves in a mirror.

**Q)** Aren't you worried about cheating?

**A)** Again, no. If you find yourself tempted to cheat, ask yourself who exactly you're cheating. It's not like there are prizes that you're depriving the rightful winners of.
